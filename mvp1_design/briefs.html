        <strong>Vladimir Putin extends reign as Russia's president.</strong> The man who was allowed to 
        score eight goals in a hockey game found even less resistance in his country's election, 
        which the White House called "obviously not free nor fair." Three days of voting with no
        oversight at the polls or any meaningful opposition ended with Putin winning six more
        years as Russia's leader, a position he has held as prime minister or president since
        1999. There was pushback from citizens on Sundayâ€”thousands of supporters of late
        opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month, made their
        voices heard at a noon protest at polling centers. Still, with his landslide victory, Putin
        could soon overtake Stalin as Russia's longest-serving leader in more than 200 years.

        <strong>Netanyahu calls Schumer's comments "inappropriate."</strong> Israeli Prime Minister
        Benjamin Netanyahu shot back at scathing criticism from Senate Majority Chuck Schumer
        last week, saying Israel is not a "banana republic" and countries should not meddle in the
        electoral affairs of other democracies (Schumer called on Israel to hold new elections).
        Meanwhile, the first shipment of aid to Gaza by sea in almost 20 yearsâ€”about 200 tons of
        foodâ€”arrived on Saturday, organized by chef Jose Andres's Central Kitchen charity.

        <strong>Fraud trial of "Britain's Bill Gates" begins today.</strong> In what prosecutors have called
        the "largest fraud in the history" of Silicon Valley, UK tech mogul Mike Lynch faces 16
        counts of criminal conspiracy and fraud stemming from the $11 billion sale of his software
        company, Autonomy, to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. HP accused Autonomy of "serious
        accounting improprieties" in November 2012, when HP announced an $8.8 billion write-
        down of its value. A 2022 civil case in London found Lynch liable for defrauding HP; in
        May 2023, he was extradited to stand trial in the US.
