### Oversight and Accountability in Public Programs

Auditor generals in Alberta and across Canada have identified significant challenges in monitoring and ensuring the effectiveness of various public programs. In Alberta, there is an urgent call for enhanced oversight of income support programs to ensure they meet the needs of vulnerable populations (Article 1, Article 2). The auditor general pointed out the lack of processes for measuring performance and reporting on the program's success, impacting nearly 48,000 households reliant on these services. Meanwhile, a federal report criticizes the oversight of a $4.6-billion infrastructure program aimed at improving transportation infrastructure. Despite the program's potential, flaws in tracking and reporting outcomes could undermine its effectiveness and alignment with sustainable development goals (Article 3). Both instances highlight a broader issue of accountability in public spending, emphasizing the need for robust performance management frameworks to safeguard the interests of citizens and ensure programs achieve their intended outcomes.

### Health-Care Restructuring in Alberta: Staff Uncertainty and Unrest

Alberta Health Services (AHS) employees face terminations and transfer offers as Alberta undergoes a major health-care overhaul. The provincial health department's restructuring plans involve converting AHS into primarily a hospital care provider, impacting staff across various departments. So far, 126 staff members have received "equivalent" job offers within Alberta Health, leading to concerns over job security, compensation, and the broader implications for health-care service delivery and staff morale (Article 1).
