### 2024 Primaries: Trump and Biden Lead

As the US prepares for the 2024 presidential election, early primaries showcase Donald Trump and Joe Biden leading their respective parties. Primaries across five states indicate a significant march toward their nominations (Article 1). Trump, with a dominant campaign despite legal challenges, and Biden, running on a platform of abortion rights, gun reform, and healthcare, are expected to secure their parties' nominations. Meanwhile, minor candidates like Marianne Williamson and Jason Palmer represent the diverse spectrum of American politics, albeit with slim chances of winning. Washington's primaries also echo these trends, solidifying Trump and Biden's positions as frontrunners (Article 2).
