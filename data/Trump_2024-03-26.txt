        "Title": "Trump's Net Worth Surge to $6.5 Billion",
        "Summary": "Donald Trump's net worth soared to $6.5 billion due to a merger between Trump Media & Technology Group and Digital World Acquisition Corp, making him one of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index's 500 wealthiest people for the first time (CNBC, USA Today). This increase came despite substantial legal challenges and operating losses for his businesses (CNBC). Trump Media, parent company of Truth Social, is set to trade under the ticker DJT (USA Today). However, it's uncertain if Trump's wealth will remain at this level due to share volatility and a prohibition on selling his shares for six months (Firstpost).",
