### Trump's Truth Social Goes Public Amid Legal and Financial Challenges

Donald Trump's social media platform, Truth Social, directed by shareholders towards a public offering, could significantly enhance his finances as he confronts costly legal battles. This move emerges while New York Attorney General Letitia James gears up to potentially seize Trump's assets over a $464m bond linked to a fraud trial (The Independent). Additionally, amid these financial and legal difficulties, discussions about potential vice-presidential candidates for Trump's 2024 run surface, including Senator Marco Rubio expressing honor at the prospect. Furthermore, Trump faces continued scrutiny over his actions surrounding the January 6 Capitol attack and his ongoing legal entanglements.
