Good morning. Hereâ€™s your briefing for today, encompassing the latest on critical events and developments.

Starting with a major incident, the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore faced a significant disruption when a cargo ship collided with it. This event is forecasted to potentially lead to insured losses ranging between $2-$4 billion. While Baltimore is not a primary port for container vessels, the impact on specific goods and the overall network flow cannot be overlooked. Maryland officials have placed a priority on the recovery process and are extending support to the families affected by this incident. Investigations are underway to explore the circumstances leading to this collapse, including the condition of the ship prior to the collision. Notably, bridge collapses due to ship impacts are rare but not without precedent globally. Sources: AP News, USA Today, CNN, ABC News.

In legal news, former President Trump's legal team is invoking the First Amendment in a Georgia election interference case. They argue that his efforts to contest the 2020 election results in Georgia are protected under free speech laws, challenging charges under the state's anti-racketeering statute. The defense posits that decisions about contested electors fall within Congressional authority, not that of Georgia officials. However, prosecutors maintain that Trump and his associates engaged in a conspiracy involving false statements, document forgery, and impersonation of officials. Sources: AP News, USA Today.

Turning to politics and legal disputes, a federal court has recently ruled that South Carolina can proceed with the 2024 congressional elections using a map previously denounced as unconstitutional.
