        "Summary": "China is reportedly using covert online accounts to support former President Trump, promote conspiracy theories, and attack President Biden ahead of the 2024 U.S. election (Council on Foreign Relations). The challenge of monitoring Chinese-language social media, like WeChat, complicates Canada's efforts to guard against foreign interference, with government officials highlighting the lack of contact with the platform's owner, Tencent, and a scarcity of monitoring tools (Toronto Star). Microsoft warns that China will likely use AI-generated content to manipulate elections in both the U.S. and India, underscoring the potential for AI to benefit China's positions in these high-profile elections. Furthermore, North Korea is expected to undertake complex cyber operations to support its regime (Global News; elblog.pl).",
