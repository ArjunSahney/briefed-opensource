        "Donald Trump, alongside co-defendants, has posted a $175 million bond in a New York civil fraud case, with financing coming from Axos Bank and linked to billionaire Don Hankey.

Trump's team contends that his real estate assets are more than sufficient to cover the bond amount, a point of contention as the appeal process continues. This development is part of a broader legal challenge facing Trump, including an expanded gag order in a separate hush money case and the upcoming testimony of Hope Hicks.",
