        "Summary": "France's construction industry is predicted to shrink by 2.5% in 2024 due to high interest rates, escalated construction material costs, and supply chain disruptions. The residential sector, crucial to over a third of the industry, is particularly hard hit, experiencing a reduction in demand and a significant drop in building permits, with a 15.7% year-on-year fall in dwelling units authorized in January 2024. Despite these challenges, investments in infrastructure and energy sectors have kept the business climate in construction stable as of February 2024. Long-term growth is expected to be driven by government and private sector investments in transport networks and green energy projects, including a \n\neu4.12 billion funding from the European Commission to support offshore wind energy development.
