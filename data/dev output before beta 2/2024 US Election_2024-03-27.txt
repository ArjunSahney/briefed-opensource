        "Summary": "The Republican National Committee is reportedly using belief in the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen as a hiring criterion, a litmus test reflecting Donald Trump's influence (Washington Post). Lara Trump, newly appointed RNC co-chair, contrasts this by stating the party should focus on the future rather than revisiting the 2020 election, even though she previously emphasized supporting Donald Trump's election efforts and legal funds (NBC News). This development coincides with Trump-backed leadership changes within the RNC (CNN).",
