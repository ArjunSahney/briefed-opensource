**UCP's Broken Promises and Favouritism**

The United Conservative Party (UCP) has gained notoriety for not keeping its promises and is now displaying a clear tendency towards favouritism. According to a recent opinion piece in the Calgary Herald, this pattern of behaviour is increasingly evident and causes concern among observers (Article 1). The shift from pledged principles to preferential treatment highlights a troubling aspect of the UCP's governance approach, spotlighting the need for scrutiny and accountability in their actions and policies.

### Political Dynamics in Alberta: Party Politics and Recall Efforts

Alberta's political landscape is witnessing notable shifts, with the Alberta government proposing to introduce party politics into local municipal elections, requiring city councillors to disclose their affiliations with provincial parties (Article 1). Concurrently, Calgary faces a groundswell of democratic engagement as a substantial petition to recall Mayor Jyoti Gondek gains momentum, challenging the city's administrative capacity to verify signatures within legislated timelines (Article 3). These developments reflect a broader discourse on governance and accountability in Alberta's municipalities, amid concerns of favoritism and the integrity of electoral commitments (Article 2).
