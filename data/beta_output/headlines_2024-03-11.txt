### Biden's Budget Proposal: A Battle of Priorities

President Biden proposes a $7.3 trillion budget with a focus on tax hikes for the wealthy and corporations, aiming for significant federal spending in various sectors, including defense, housing, and student debt cancellation (Article 1). The proposal, which seeks to increase the tax burden to historic highs, faces criticism for potentially leading to "the highest sustained income tax burden in American history" (Article 1). House GOP leaders condemn the plan as an example of "reckless spending" and a push for a left-wing agenda at the expense of American taxpayers (Article 2). The budget, unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled House, is symbolic and sets the stage for fiscal debates ahead of the upcoming elections, highlighting the stark contrasts between Democratic and Republican budgetary visions (Article 2, Article 3).

### Crisis Summit on Haiti

Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Caribbean leaders in Jamaica, discussing Haiti's escalating crisis (Article 1, Article 3). Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry, pressured to resign or form a transitional council, was notably absent, stranded abroad due to gang violence (Article 1, Article 2). Talks, facilitated by Caricom, aim to establish a transitional government amidst gang-led violence that has killed scores, destroyed infrastructure, and displaced thousands (Article 1, Article 2). The UN Security Council calls for immediate action against the gangs and supports the deployment of a multinational force to stabilize Haiti (Article 1, Article 2, Article 3).

### Marcia Fudge's Departure and Legacy

Marcia Fudge, the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary, announced her retirement, marking her departure on March 22 as one of the few Biden administration Cabinet members to step down (Article 1, Article 2). Throughout her tenure, Fudge was instrumental in addressing significant housing issues, such as the affordable housing shortage and appraisal bias, and enhancing homeownership opportunities, especially for Black and Hispanic communities (Article 1). Fudge's leadership has been pivotal in the Biden administration's efforts to rebuild fair housing and civil rights protections and improve equity in housing accessibility (Article 2). Her departure is seen as a significant moment for HUD and the administration, leaving a legacy of progress in combating homelessness and promoting fairness for renters and homebuyers amidst challenges.
