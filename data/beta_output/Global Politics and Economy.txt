### Summary: Trump's Presidency and Global Implications

Nouriel Roubini, an economist, has voiced concerns that a potential Donald Trump reelection poses significant threats to the global economy by potentially stoking inflation, increasing fiscal deficits, and initiating new trade wars (Article 1). Additionally, Trump's praise of authoritarian leaders like Viktor Orbán and even his unsettling comments on Adolf Hitler reflect a foreign policy stance that greatly diverges from traditional U.S. principles, potentially altering America's role on the global stage if he were reelected (Article 2). On another front, the U.S. actively seeks to prevent China from acquiring advanced technology such as computer chips for military use, demonstrating ongoing tensions between the two superpowers, which could be exacerbated by Trump's adversarial trade policies (Article 3).
