### Amazon's Attempt at Worker Wellness

Amazon has launched "ZenBooths" and a wellness program called "Working Well" to enhance warehouse employees' morale and reduce injury rates. These initiatives include meditation guides and wellness exercises, purportedly to support employees' mental and physical health. However, the response from employees and the public has been largely critical, highlighting Amazon's high workplace injury rates and demanding conditions. Critics accuse the effort of being out of touch, especially given reports of strenuous working environments at Amazon's warehouses (Article 1).

### Small Caps Outshine the Tech Giants

Despite the "Magnificent Seven" tech giants, including Nvidia, leading the stock market to new highs in 2023 with significant market cap gains, 2024 sees a shift. A focus group from the Russell 2000 Index is outperforming these giants, suggesting a transition in investor preference towards smaller-cap stocks with strong YTD gains. Particularly highlighted are Viking Therapeutics and SoundHound AI, experiencing substantial increases and favorable analyst ratings, pointing to a broader market trend of looking beyond the tech behemoths for investment opportunities (Article 2).
