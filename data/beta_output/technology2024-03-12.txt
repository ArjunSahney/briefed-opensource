### Combating CCP's Threat on U.S. Communications Technology

The House Energy and Commerce Communications and Technology Subcommittee, led by Chairs Bob Latta and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is taking decisive action against the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) threats to U.S. communications networks. Through the markup of four crucial bills, they aim to secure these networks by addressing vulnerabilities and ensuring technological sovereignty (Article 1, Article 2). These efforts include proposing legislation to limit the use of high-risk equipment and technology from companies with ties to adversaries such as the CCP. The bills focus on various aspects, including counteracting CCP drones, enhancing transparency for companies with foreign ties, advancing 6G technology through a task force, and assessing the security risks of consumer routers. These measures underscore a bipartisan commitment to addressing the significant and complex threats posed by the CCP and other adversaries to both national security and technological leadership.

### Sustainable Future Through Data and IT Optimization

Enterprises are increasingly leveraging sustainability data and IT resource optimization to meet the growing demands of regulatory changes, stakeholder expectations, and eco-conscious customers (Articles 1, 3). Companies use sustainability data to drive improvements across operations, focusing on reducing carbon emissions and enhancing eco-friendliness (Article 1). Meanwhile, IBM introduces services to optimize IT infrastructure, aiming to reduce energy consumption, manage aging IT equipment, and ensure secure data erasure, thereby supporting data center sustainability (Articles 2, 3). These initiatives reflect a broader shift towards environmental responsibility in the IT sector, underlining the importance of sustainable practices in achieving operational efficiency and compliance with global ESG regulation (Article 2, 3).
