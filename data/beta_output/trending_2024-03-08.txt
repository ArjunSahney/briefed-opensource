### Ancient Myths Enter the Battle Royale

Fortnite has launched its next season, Chapter 5: Season 2, infusing the game with a rich theme of Greek mythology, introducing locations like Mount Olympus and the underworld, and featuring play as legendary gods wielding formidable powers such as Zeus' thunderbolt (Article 1). This season's Fortnite Battle Pass reinforces this mythological theme, offering skins of various Greek gods and goddesses as well as Korra from "Avatar: The Last Airbender" series, as a special unlockable character later in the season (Article 1, Article 2). The introduction of mythical items like the Wings of Icarus and the Chains of Hades adds a new layer of gameplay, emphasizing the blend of ancient myths with Fortnite's contemporary battle royale setting.
