### The Exodus of Nagorno-Karabakh (Article 1)

The once vibrant and populous region of Nagorno-Karabakh stands emptied after an Azerbaijani military campaign, displacing over 100,000 ethnic Armenians. The escalation followed long-standing tensions within this legally Azerbaijani, ethnically Armenian territory. With the areaâ€™s status complicated by its Soviet-era designation and recent conflicts, the aftermath reveals a dire humanitarian crisis. Displaced residents face a precarious future, with little support from the Armenian government or international community. Amidst ongoing peace talks, claims of ethnic cleansing and the right of return remain contentious issues, illustrating a deep-rooted and unresolved conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

Concurrently, tensions simmer on the Armenian front, as Azerbaijan demands the withdrawal of Armenian forces from contested border areas, underscoring regional geopolitical complexities (Article 2). This juxtaposition of economic collaboration with geopolitical strife highlights the multifaceted dynamics between national security, international alliances, and economic strategies in the evolving landscape of global relations.
