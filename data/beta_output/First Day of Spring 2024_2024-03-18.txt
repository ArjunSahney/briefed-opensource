### Spring Equinox 2024: A Time of Balance and Renewal

Spring officially begins on March 19, 2024, with the arrival of the vernal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere. This event marks a period when the Earth's axis and its orbit align to ensure both hemispheres receive an equal amount of sunlight. The term "equinox" is derived from Latin, symbolizing equal night, as day and night are almost the same duration during this time (Article 1, Article 2). The equinox embodies a time of balance, with traditions celebrating new beginnings and growth as daylight begins to increase, leading up to the summer solstice (Article 3).
