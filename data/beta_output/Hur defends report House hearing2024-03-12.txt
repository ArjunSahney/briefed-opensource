### Special Counsel's Testimony on Biden's Document Handling: A Political Battlefield

During a Congressional hearing, Special Counsel Robert Hur stood by his assessment regarding President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents after his vice presidency, amidst a heated debate reflecting the bigger political showdown between Biden and Donald Trump. Despite questioning Biden's age and mental competence, Hur found insufficient evidence for criminal charges against Biden, emphasizing the investigation's impartiality. The hearing underscored a stark divide, with Republicans criticizing the lack of charges against Biden and contrasting Trump's ongoing legal challenges over document mishandling. Democrats highlighted Biden's cooperation with the investigation, contrasting it with Trump's more confrontational stance (Article 1). Concurrently, the Pentagon announced a significant military aid package for Ukraine, illustrating the broader geopolitical concerns amid domestic political strife (Article 2). Hur's testimony reignited debates over the handling of classified information, with both parties using the opportunity to score political points against their opponents, showcasing the intense polarization ahead of the elections (Article 3).
