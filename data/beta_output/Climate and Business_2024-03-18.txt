### Digital Tools Revolutionizing Climate Action and Forecasting

The En-ROADS simulator, co-developed by Climate Interactive and MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, provides an innovative approach for visualizing the impact of environmental policies and industry actions on global climate through 2100 (Article 1). Similarly, Nvidia announces its Earth-2 digital twin and platform, aimed at harnessing AI to enhance climate forecasting, highlighting the platform's operational rollout for detailed weather simulation and its integration with Omniverse for creating 3D workflows (Articles 2, 3). These tools serve as powerful instruments for businesses, policymakers, and researchers in understanding and combating climate change through strategic planning and simulation.

### Temporary Halt on SEC Climate Disclosure Rules

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has temporarily stayed the SEC's new climate disclosure rules, delaying their implementation amid ongoing litigation by businesses and GOP-led states questioning the SEC's authority on environmental concerns (Article 1, Article 2). The rules, requiring companies to disclose greenhouse gas emissions, are challenged on constitutional and statutory grounds, including violations of the major questions doctrine and the First Amendment (Article 3). This stay is immediate, although it does not conclude the rule's lawfulness, pending a deeper legal review.
