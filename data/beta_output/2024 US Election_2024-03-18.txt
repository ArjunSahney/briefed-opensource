### 2024 U.S. Election Poll Analysis

Recent polling data showcases a tight race between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump for the 2024 Presidential Election. Trump currently leads Biden in several polls, with most national polls giving him a low single-digit margin advantage. This is despite both candidates having secured their party nominations with significant primary votes (Article 2). However, recent surveys by Morning Consult indicate a tied race between Trump and Biden, with both standing at 43% among registered voters. Trump maintains a higher net favorability rating compared to Biden, indicating a potential edge. Additionally, issues like the economy, national security, health care, and immigration are top of mind for voters heading into the election (Article 3).
