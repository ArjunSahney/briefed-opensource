### Armenia's Shift in Airport Security Management

Armenia has decided to terminate a security arrangement with Russia at Zvartnots International Airport, with Russian border guards to leave by August 1 (Article 1, Article 2). Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan highlighted that Armenia’s border control is now capable enough to manage the airport’s security independently (Article 3). This move underscores a gradual distancing from reliance on Russia, amidst dissatisfaction with Moscow's support in recent territorial disputes with Azerbaijan. Furthermore, Armenia is exploring security collaborations with Western partners, notably France, as it reassesses its engagement with the Moscow-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organization (Article 1).

### Exploring a New Quad: Greece, Armenia, India, and France

The Greek Defense Minister, Nikolaos Dendias, has proposed a new Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or "Quad," during his visit to Armenia, aiming to strengthen ties between Greece, Armenia, India, and France. This proposition underlines the shifting geopolitical landscape and the diverse interests driving these nations closer, ranging from democratic values to concerns over political Islam and regional security challenges. While each country comes from a distinct strategic backdrop—including NATO members and allies of Russia—their mutual interests in democracy, security, and counteracting expansionist narratives present a compelling case for cooperation. The potential alliance also reflects each nation's broader strategic objectives, like drawing India and Armenia closer to Western spheres of influence and enhancing their defense partnerships (Article 1).
