**Attracting Talent with Tax Incentives in Alberta**

To address labor shortages, Alberta has unveiled a tax credit exclusively targeting skilled tradespeople, offering a $5,000 refundable tax credit to entice them to move to the province (Article 1). This initiative, part of the Alberta is Calling Attraction Bonus, pivots from previous campaign promises by focusing strictly on trades such as electricians and crane operators to quickly meet market demand. The shift includes legislative adjustments to the Alberta Personal Income Tax Act, underscoring a strategic move to fuel economic growth and infrastructure projects by attracting a workforce critically needed for Alberta's future (Article 2).

### Alberta's Electricity Market Update

Alberta's government is taking steps to amend its electricity market rules, aiming to reduce utility bills for consumers (Article 1). These changes are set to tackle "economic withholding," a strategy that power generators use to offer electricity at higher prices, impacting consumer costs and the reliability of supply during peak periods. The new rules will cap the offer price for natural gas generators under certain conditions and require these assets to be available during extreme weather and peak demand times. However, there are concerns that these measures might deter investment in new generating capacity, potentially leading to less generation in the long term (Article 1). Additionally, Alberta is preparing for a significant restructuring of its power market by 2027, which could further influence the province's energy landscape (Article 2).
