### Celeb Scams and Nuptials Update

Deepfaked celebrities, including a fake Martin Luther King, Jr., have been promoting a Trump scam on social media, misleading viewers into unknowingly signing up for recurring charges under the guise of supporting the former president. This scam, investigated by Forbes, involved sophisticated ad campaigns and complicated web of entities to evade detection and legal action. Despite extensive ad spends suggesting millions could be lost by victims, there is no evidence tying these scams directly to Trump or his campaign. On an entirely different note, Taiwanese singer Huang Pin Yuan has married Russian pianist Alina Gorshenina in Beijing, marking his second marriage amidst a lavish ceremony with notable guests from the entertainment industry (Article 1, Article 2).
