### Paul Alexander: A Life of Resilience

Paul Alexander, who earned the Guinness World Record for the longest survival in an iron lung, passed away at the age of 78 after a battle with Covid (Article 2, Article 3).

Despite his physical limitations, he achieved remarkable feats, including obtaining a law degree, authoring a memoir, and inspiring many with his life's story shared through various platforms, like his TikTok account "Polio Paul" (Article 1, Article 3). His relentless spirit and contributions left a lasting impact, remembered by friends, family, and followers worldwide (Article 3).
