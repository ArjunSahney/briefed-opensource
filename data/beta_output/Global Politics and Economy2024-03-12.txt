### China's Lingering Economic Crisis and Political Shifts

China is grappling with severe economic difficulties and a notable political shift under Xi Jinping's leadership. Despite official claims of economic growth, the reality tells a different story of unaddressed economic challenges, including a deepening property crisis, soaring local government debt, and rising youth unemployment. The National People's Congress offered no solutions, highlighting the government's uncertainty on proceeding (Article 1). Furthermore, the cancellation of annual press conferences and lack of transparency signal a significant political change. This move, amidst internal disunity and confrontational external policies, underscores the centralization and decreased transparency within the Communist Party, raising concerns about China's stability and leadership capability (Article 2).
