### Elden Ring Summoning Guide

In Elden Ring, players can summon a variety of allies including Spirit Ashes, NPCs, other players, and even the spirit steed Torrent to aid them in the treacherous Lands Between. To summon Spirit Ashes, a Spirit Calling Bell is required, which is not available at the start but can be unlocked (Article 1). NPCs can be summoned for specific boss fights without needing the bell or FP, and the ability to summon them depends on prior interactions. For co-op play, players utilize items like the Furlcalling Finger Remedy to summon others, or the Tarnished's Furled Finger to offer their assistance. Torrent can be summoned with the Spectral Steed Whistle, provided by Melina, without using FP (Article 1).
