### Cyclone Megan's Impact on Australia

Cyclone Megan struck Northern Australia, bringing with it heavy flooding and evacuations in areas like Australia's Northern Territory (Article 1, Article 2). As Megan approached, it was labeled a Category 3 storm, inflicting significant damage including flooded roads and power outages (Article 2). However, it later weakened to a tropical low, minimizing infrastructure damage but leaving concerns over possible supply disruptions due to continued heavy rainfall (Article 3). Emergency responses included failed evacuation attempts and local efforts to safeguard the community (Article 3).
