### Sustainable Arbitration through Technology

Technology significantly boosts sustainable arbitration by improving efficiency, transparency, and environmental friendliness throughout the dispute resolution process (Article 1). The drive for sustainability in arbitration is supported by client demand and initiatives like the Campaign for Greener Arbitrations. Modern arbitration technologies reduce paper use, promote AI integration, enhance data security, and streamline the management of digital media (Article 1). Virtual hearings facilitate participation from remote locations, breaking down geographical barriers and offering educational opportunities for junior lawyers (Article 1). Moreover, the use of centralized document management systems overcomes the inefficiencies and environmental drawbacks of traditional methods like email, further evidencing technology's role in achieving sustainable arbitration practices (Article 1).
