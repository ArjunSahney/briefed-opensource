### Biden and Trump Vie for Teamsters' Support 

President Joe Biden is actively engaging with the Teamsters, a significant labor union with 1.3 million members, in a bid to secure their endorsement for the 2024 election (Article 1, Article 2, Article 3). Recognizing himself as the "most pro-labor President in U.S. history", Biden has already garnered the support of various other unions, including the AFL-CIO and the UAW, and is now focusing on the Teamsters, who have yet to announce their endorsement (Article 1). Both Biden and former President Donald Trump, who has also met with the Teamsters, are competing for this crucial endorsement as they recognize its potential impact, especially in key battleground states (Article 2, Article 3). The Teamsters are conducting national polls and holding town halls to gauge their members' opinions before making a decision, reflecting the importance of ensuring that the chosen candidate aligns with the union's priorities and member interests (Article 2, Article 3).

### Nominations Within Reach for Trump and Biden

In the upcoming Republican and Democratic primaries across states including Georgia, Washington, and Mississippi, both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden are on the verge of securing their respective party nominations for the 2024 Presidential Election (Article 1, Article 2, Article 3). Trump, who has led the Republican field without engaging in debates and despite facing multiple felony charges, needs fewer than 140 delegates to reach the 1,215 required for a Republican nomination. Biden, with no significant challengers, needs only 100 more delegates to secure the Democratic nomination (Article 1). Both candidates are poised to clinch their nominations today, setting the stage for a possible rematch in the 2024 Presidential Election (Article 2, Article 3).
