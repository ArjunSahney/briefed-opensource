### Special Counsel's Testimony on Biden's Document Handling: A Political Battlefield

During a Congressional hearing, Special Counsel Robert Hur stood by his assessment regarding President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents after his vice presidency, amidst a heated debate reflecting the bigger political showdown between Biden and Donald Trump. Despite questioning Biden's age and mental competence, Hur found insufficient evidence for criminal charges against Biden, emphasizing the investigation's impartiality. The hearing underscored a stark divide, with Republicans criticizing the lack of charges against Biden and contrasting Trump's ongoing legal challenges over document mishandling. Democrats highlighted Biden's cooperation with the investigation, contrasting it with Trump's more confrontational stance (Article 1). Concurrently, the Pentagon announced a significant military aid package for Ukraine, illustrating the broader geopolitical concerns amid domestic political strife (Article 2). Hur's testimony reignited debates over the handling of classified information, with both parties using the opportunity to score political points against their opponents, showcasing the intense polarization ahead of the elections (Article 3).

**Understanding February 2024's Inflation Report**

February 2024 saw a noticeable uptick in inflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by 0.4% for the month and 3.2% over the past year, slightly above expectations (Article 2, Article 3). Core inflation, excluding the more volatile food and energy sectors, also rose by 0.4% monthly and 3.8% annually (Article 1, Article 3). Despite these increases, some areas, such as core goods, have seen prices fall, suggesting easing inflation in certain sectors. Housing costs continue to be a significant contributor to overall inflation, reflecting the United States' long-term housing supply shortage. Efforts are underway to improve housing affordability and increase the stock of affordable homes (Article 1). Energy and food prices showed a mixed impact, with energy costs rising and grocery inflation decreasing substantially from the previous year (Article 1). These developments come as the Federal Reserve signals cautious optimism about inflation trends but emphasizes the need for confidence that inflation is moving back towards its 2% target before considering interest rate cuts (Article 3).
