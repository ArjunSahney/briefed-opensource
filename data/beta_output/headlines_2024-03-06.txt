### Nikki Haley Ends Presidential Bid

Nikki Haley, former South Carolina Governor, has exited the Republican presidential race, conceding the nomination to Donald Trump. Despite strong debate performances and building momentum with donations and endorsements, Haley faced losses in GOP nominating contests, including her home state (Article 2). She achieved victories in Vermont and Washington, D.C., but it wasn't enough to sustain her campaign. Haley emphasized the importance of Trump earning the support of her backers and other voters and highlighted her efforts to voice the concerns of Americans without regrets (Article 1, Article 3). Despite her departure, she vows to continue advocating for her beliefs as a private citizen.
