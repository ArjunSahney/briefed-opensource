### Olivia Munn's Courageous Battle with Breast Cancer

Olivia Munn disclosed her breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent double mastectomy, following an aggressive, fast-moving cancer found in both breasts (Article 1, Article 2, Article 3). Despite a negative genetic test and normal mammogram in early 2023, Munn's condition was diagnosed thanks to a calculated risk assessment by her OBGYN (Article 3). Over ten months, she underwent four surgeries, maintaining privacy to navigate the most challenging moments of recovery (Article 2, Article 3). Munn's openness about her journey aims to offer hope and solidarity to others facing similar battles, underscoring the importance of early detection and proactive healthcare (Article 1, Article 2, Article 3).
