        "Summary": "The trial concerning Donald Trump's hush money case is officially scheduled to start on April 15, as decided by Judge Juan Merchan. Despite Trump and his legal team's efforts for a delay, citing reasons such as late evidence turnover and pre-trial publicity, the request was firmly denied. Trump criticized the trial date as 'election interference', a claim reflecting his consistent stance against the legal proceedings. The charges involve falsifying business records related to payments made to silence claims of an affair, with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen playing a central role. This trial marks a significant event as it positions Trump as the first former president in U.S. history to face a criminal trial (AP News, NBC News, CNN, ABC News).",

        "Summary": "A judge set April 15 as the start date for Donald Trump's hush money trial, where he faces charges for allegedly falsifying business records connected to a 2016 campaign-related payment. Concurrently, an appeals court lowered Trump's required bond in a separate civil fraud case from nearly half a billion dollars to $175 million, giving him additional time to post it. Trump criticized the trial's timing as election interference, while his legal team prepared for a potentially overlapping trial schedule with other legal matters. Trump, asserting his readiness to testify, also lamented the financial burden of the bond on his reelection campaign funding (CNN, NPR, Washington Post, New York Post, NBC News).",

The merger values Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group, at about $5.5 billion, with Trump's stake valued around $3 billion, despite the platform's financial losses and a relatively small user base compared to giants like Facebook and TikTok. The stock is expected to be volatile, reflecting Trump's controversial public figure status and the platform's struggle for growth in the competitive social media market (USA Today, ABC News, 90.5 WESA, InvestorPlace)."
