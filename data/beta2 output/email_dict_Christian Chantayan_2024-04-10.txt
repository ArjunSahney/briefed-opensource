            "Summary": "Following the U.S.'s withdrawal from the nuclear pact six years ago, Iran has progressively moved closer to possessing nuclear weapons capabilities, a scenario confirmed by confidential inspection reports and expert interviews. This development is exacerbated by Iran's strengthened alliance with Russia, emboldening its stance against Western pressures despite Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's reaffirmation against the use of weapons of mass destruction, in line with Islamic principles. Nevertheless, Iran is navigating a path to become a threshold nuclear state, capable of developing nuclear bombs without actively pursuing them, thus avoiding potential military confrontations (Washington Post).",
