        "Summary": "In North Carolina, Trump has a slight edge over Biden with 41% to 38% in a poll considering third-party candidates (USA Today). Nationwide polling, however, shows Biden nearly tied or leading Trump across various polls by reputable sources (New York Magazine). A key swing state poll indicates a razor-thin lead for Trump, diverging from some recent national trends (Benzinga). Meanwhile, President Biden faces unfavorable poll numbers on two major issues ahead of the 2024 election (The Daily Caller) and diminishing support among Black men (National Review).",
