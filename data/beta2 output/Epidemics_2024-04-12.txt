The strategies mentioned include mapping the surroundings, reinforcing structures to be fire-resistant, clearing vegetation, and creating buffer zones, analogous to public health practices like contact tracing, mask mandates, vaccinations, and social distancing. The significance of identifying high-vulnerability areas (buildings or vegetation) and the importance of real-time data updating for effective wildfire damage mitigation are also discussed (Nature).",
