Concurrently, record highs in CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide levels were reported for 2023, albeit with a slower growth rate, indicating persistent environmental challenges (Earth.Org). The Science Based Targets Initiative's decision to allow carbon offsetting for Scope 3 emissions has sparked considerable backlash, reflecting concerns over the integrity of net-zero claims (Down To Earth).
