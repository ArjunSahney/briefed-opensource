            "Summary": "International law permits anticipatory self-defense under certain conditions, potentially justifying Israeli preemptive strikes against Iran to prevent nuclear armament (Modern Diplomacy). U.S. policy faces challenges with Israel-Iran tensions, especially following an Israeli strike in Syria that killed members of Iran's IRGC, leading to concerns over catastrophic reprisals (Al Jazeera). Israel's ongoing military operations in Syria, termed 'the war between the wars', target Iranian arms shipments and personnel, increasing the risk of a wider conflict (Crisis Group). Iran's recent hijacking of an Israel-linked cargo ship represents a significant breach of international law, escalating regional tensions further (Sky News).",
