        "Summary": "President Biden anticipates an imminent Iranian attack on Israel, amidst a backdrop of rising hostilities and U.S. warnings against such actions (The New York Times; The Times of Israel). The grim situation is underscored by the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, where over 1,200 people have been killed, and efforts for a ceasefire and hostage release remain uncertain (The Jerusalem Post). In response to the looming threat from Iran, the U.S. is deploying additional military assets to the Middle East to deter Iran and protect American forces (Sky News). Iranian officials threaten retaliation against Israel, stressing the imminence of a missile blitz, which could escalate into a wider war if Iran targets Israeli soil (inews.co.uk).",
