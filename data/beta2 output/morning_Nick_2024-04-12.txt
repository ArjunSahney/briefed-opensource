Good morning, Nick. Here's your morning briefing for today:

Starting with international developments, the situation in the Middle East remains tense. According to CNN, a recent Israeli airstrike in Gaza resulted in at least 29 casualties. This escalation has heightened concerns regarding Israel's readiness for potential Iranian responses. Amidst these growing tensions, NBC News reports that the U.S. has restricted staff travel in Israel due to fears of Iranian attacks. The Guardian notes that while the White House acknowledges the ongoing threat to Israel from Iran, there are international efforts underway to prevent further escalation. Haaretz adds that the U.S. perceives the threat from Iran as 'real and viable' and that Israel has taken measures against Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza.
