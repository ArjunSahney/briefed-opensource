Good morning Akshi,

Starting with the situation in the Middle East, there have been notable developments. According to CNN, a recent Israeli airstrike in Gaza has claimed at least 29 lives, underlining the escalating tensions in the region. Compounding these concerns, NBC News reports that the U.S. has limited its staff travel in Israel amidst growing fears of Iranian attacks. Furthermore, The Guardian has highlighted the White House's acknowledgement of the ongoing risk of an Iranian attack on Israeli soil, as international efforts are underway to avoid further escalation. In related news, Haaretz adds that Israel is taking decisive measures against Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, in light of the deemed 'real and viable' threat from Iran.

Shifting focus to Ukraine, the conflict there continues to evolve. NBC News has highlighted Ukraine's strained efforts to fortify its defenses amid delays in U.S. aid, essential for countering Russian aggression.

Sky News has documented Russia's intensified assaults and ambitions to seize strategic locations, disputing any suggestions of a straightforward Russian victory in key cities like Kharkiv. Calls for increased military support to Ukraine are growing louder, underscored by reports from Yahoo News UK and Yahoo News Canada, as the country seeks global backing to deter Russian advances and address the humanitarian crisis.
