Critics, including LGBTQ+ activists and allies, argue these positions invalidate the lived experiences of gender-expansive individuals and overlook the benefits of gender-affirming healthcare. Meanwhile, the White House acknowledges the Vatican's efforts to protect LGBTQ+ individuals from violence, despite disagreements on health care perspectives for transgender people (NPR, AP News).",

Advocates argue this change mirrors the founders' intent and strengthens the state's unified voice, while critics see it as diminishing diverse political representation.
