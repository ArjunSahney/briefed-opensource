            "Summary": "The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill aimed at banning TikTok, highlighting national security concerns due to its Chinese ownership and the potential collection of vast amounts of user data (Euronews.com, USA Today). TikTok criticizes the move, arguing it infringes on free speech rights, would harm businesses, and negatively impact the U.S. economy (ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos, USA Today). There's also discussion around forcing a sale of TikTok rather than an outright ban, with the Biden administration expressing concerns over data collection but not advocating for a complete prohibition (USA Today). TikTok's CEO vows to fight the legislation, which has been attacked as unconstitutional by several civil society groups (CNN).",
