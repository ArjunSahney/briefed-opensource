Good morning, Paul. Here's your morning briefing with today's top news stories.

Starting in Scotland, we have a critical political development. According to the Washington Post and The Guardian, Scotland's First Minister, Humza Yousaf, is currently facing a pivotal confidence vote. This comes amidst controversy surrounding his decision to end the SNP-Green coalition. Despite the erosion of his party's authority and the pressing need for major concessions to his critics, Yousaf has stated he has no intention of resigning and is "very confident" of winning the vote. The situation demands intricate negotiations and compromises, notably Yousaf's outreach to other parties, including the Greens, to ensure his political survival. The broader implications for governance and policy direction in Scotland are also part of the unfolding discussions.

Moving to the United States, the University of Southern California (USC) has canceled its main commencement ceremony due to concerns over pro-Palestinian protests linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict. This decision, as reported by Axios and the Los Angeles Times among others, follows tensions on campus, which included a clash between demonstrators and campus security. The cancellation has spurred criticism from students and alumni, particularly because it was announced after a pro-Palestinian student valedictorian was disallowed from speaking at the event. This incident reflects wider unrest on U.S. college campuses regarding the Middle Eastern conflict.

In the realm of technology and healthcare, InfoWorld reports on a significant development. The Meditron LLM suite, developed through collaboration between EPFL and Yale School of Medicine with support from ICRC, utilizes Meta's Llama2 platform. This suite aims to revolutionize healthcare by enhancing the quality of medical data through superior training methodologies.

In addition, TechTalks highlighted an advance in Large Language Models (LLMs) technology. The expansion of context windows from 2,048 tokens in GPT-3 to a staggering million in Gemini 1.5 Pro, with aims toward infinite tokens, is a landmark achievement. Techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) are being leveraged to efficiently fine-tune numerous LLMs without the complexity of managing billions of parameters for each model.

Shifting to the business and investment sector, Capria Ventures has successfully closed its India Opportunity Fund at about Rs 153 crore, as reported by sources like Business Standard and Entrackr. Following a fruitful exit from investment in Awign, the fund targets early and early-growth stage startups in the global South, spanning fintech, jobtech, edtech, agtech, climate, and SaaS sectors.

Lastly, in sports, the UFC Fight Night featuring Nicolau versus Perez has garnered attention, with CBS Sports providing odds and predictions for the event. UFC Vegas 91 has also been making waves due to its weigh-in and the introduction of controversial betting odds by Draft Kings, allowing fans to bet on whether fighters would fail to make weight, according to MMAmania.com.

That concludes your morning briefing, Paul. Wishing you a productive day ahead.
