Good morning, Karan. Here's your morning briefing with the latest updates:

Starting with political developments from Scotland, First Minister Humza Yousaf is currently facing a significant confidence vote against a backdrop of political upheaval. This comes in the wake of Yousaf terminating the SNP-Green coalition, a move that has put his leadership to the test. Despite the challenges, Yousaf remains optimistic, expressing 'very confidence' in securing a victory. The situation underscores the necessity for compromise and outreach, notably to parties such as the Greens, ensuring Yousaf's political survivability amidst calls for governance and policy reevaluation. This story is reported by The Washington Post and The Guardian, among others.

Switching to education and protest news in the United States, the University of Southern California (USC) has made headlines by canceling its main commencement ceremony. This decision comes amid growing concerns over pro-Palestinian protests on campus, primarily related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. The cancellation, which follows an altercation between demonstrators and campus security, has sparked criticism from both students and alumni. Wide unrest on college campuses across the U.S. regarding the Middle Eastern conflict mirrors this situation, as detailed by reports from Axios and the Los Angeles Times.

In the realm of real estate, a survey involving 1,004 Latvian residents reveals an expectation among nearly half of the respondents for a rise in real estate prices in the coming period, according to the Baltic News Network. Meanwhile, Warren Buffett's real-estate firm has reportedly settled a legal dispute for $250 million, a significant development reported by Business Insider.

Turning to healthcare, the ongoing conflict in Gaza has placed a tremendous mental strain on healthcare workers, while a United Nations expert has raised alarms over the looming mental health crisis among Gaza's citizens. In a more distressing update, a premature baby girl, delivered posthumously from her mother who was killed in an airstrike, tragically passed away after five days in incubation. These reports are covered by MSF, Doctors Without Borders, and WRAL.com. Additionally, Calenda has criticized the collective political failure leading to healthcare underfunding, calling for a unified approach to address the issue. This was reported by Agenzia Nova.

Lastly, in fintech news, Sentinum, a subsidiary of Ault Alliance, has announced its first non-mining related colocation/hosting agreement, signaling a significant expansion of its services. This development is covered by FinTech Futures.

That concludes your morning briefing, Karan. Have a great day ahead.
