**Evolving Relations and Pressing Global Issues**

Armenia is in regular contact with Turkey, as both countries seek to normalize their historically tense relations. These efforts were highlighted by Armenian Foreign Minister Mirzoyan's interview with Turkish Anadolu news agency, emphasizing ongoing conversations between leaders Pashinian and Erdogan (Article 1). Meanwhile, global concerns persist across various realms, including human rights, with instances such as the extended imprisonment of Tajik businessman Kholiqzoda over his autobiography, reflecting crackdowns on freedom of expression. Additionally, the conviction of Kazakh activists and the incarceration of RFE/RL journalist Yesypenko by Russian-appointed courts in Crimea underline ongoing struggles against political suppression. The complex tapestry of international relations, human rights issues, and efforts towards societal normalization continue to shape the current global landscape.

### Armenia Asserts Independence from Russian Border Guards (Article 1)

Armenia has informed Russia that its border guards are no longer needed at Yerevan's Zvartnots Airport, marking a significant move towards independence in border management. This decision reflects Armenia's growing confidence in handling its border guard services and comes amid deteriorating relations with Russia, especially after disagreements over security issues related to Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite Kremlin's lack of acknowledgment of this decision, Armenia's move signals a new phase in its national security strategy, distancing itself from Russian military and security influences.
