        "Summary": "A Canadian distillery, T-Rex, has stopped producing 4L vodka jugs after a photo went viral and amid concerns from Alberta's Service Alberta minister, reflecting mixed public feedback (Daily Hive, CBC). The decision comes despite the company stating Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis had approved the product, and there were no clear pricing guidelines provided by the agency (CTV News). This move highlights ongoing issues with spirit pricing and regulations in Alberta, where the requirement for craft distilleries to produce a majority of their spirits in-house was removed, leading to unsustainable prices (CTV News).",
