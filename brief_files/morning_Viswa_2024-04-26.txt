Good morning, Viswa. Here's your morning briefing with the latest updates.

Starting with political news, Scotland's First Minister, Humza Yousaf, is currently facing a crucial confidence vote after ending the SNP-Green coalition. According to The Washington Post and The Guardian, despite the lack of a full majority and the need for significant compromises, Yousaf has expressed he is 'very confident' about winning the vote and has no plans to resign. This political maneuver involves reaching out to other parties, including the Greens, to ensure his survival amidst a broader discussion on governance and policy directions.

In the United States, the University of Southern California (USC) has canceled its main commencement ceremony due to concerns over pro-Palestinian protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict, reports Axios and the Los Angeles Times. This decision followed tensions on campus, including a clash between demonstrators and campus security. The cancellation, especially after the decision that a pro-Palestinian student valedictorian would not be allowed to speak, has drawn criticism from both students and alumni. This incident mirrors a wider unrest seen across U.S. college campuses regarding the Middle East conflict.

Turning our focus to the telecommunications sector, Spectrum has expanded its services to 190 homes and small businesses in Calhoun County, South Carolina, as part of a $5 billion initiative to boost rural broadband connectivity, according to Charter Communications. This move marks a significant effort to close the digital divide in rural America.

Meanwhile, T-Mobile and AT&T are making waves in the telecommunications industry. T-Mobile, as reported by Light Reading and FierceWireless, is on a robust growth trajectory with plans to reach 3.5 million homes with fiber by 2028 and a significant boost in subscribers following the acquisition of Mint. AT&T has also shown a strong first quarter performance despite some declines, highlighting the competitive nature of the industry, as noted by VoIP Review.

On the downside, Charter Communications has experienced a loss of 72,000 internet customers in the first quarter, with a significant downturn in stock prices, according to XM and Morningstar. This loss is attributed to higher network expansion spending, amidst declining video subscribers but an addition of mobile lines.

In educational technology news, a Maryland high school teacher was arrested for using AI to generate a fake audio clip framing the school principal with racist and antisemitic remarks, reported by NBC News and CBS News. This incident, leveraging OpenAI and Microsoft Bing Chat tools, has raised concerns over the misuse of AI technology.

And finally, in Hong Kong, there's a growing criticism of the integration of AI in education, focusing too much on Western-centric AI models, as highlighted by the South China Morning Post. This approach risks overlooking cultural relevance in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, Hong Kong has recently commemorated World Intellectual Property Day 2024, emphasizing the importance of intellectual property in the region.

That concludes your morning briefing, Viswa. Have a great day ahead.
