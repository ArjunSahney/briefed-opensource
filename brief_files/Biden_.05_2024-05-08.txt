        "Title": "Trump Criticizes Biden on Antisemitism Amid Rising Tensions",
        "Summary": "Donald Trump has accused Joe Biden of being weak on antisemitism in response to campus protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict, ignoring criticisms of his own rhetoric on the issue. The Trump campaign and affiliated Republican groups released a video contrasting their stance on antisemitism with Biden's, amid reports of large-scale protests and violent demonstrations. Meanwhile, Biden plans to address antisemitism at a Holocaust remembrance event, as public opinion shows nuanced views towards the Israel-Palestine conflict (ABC News, Benzinga, Colorado Springs Gazette, Yahoo, Washington Examiner).",
