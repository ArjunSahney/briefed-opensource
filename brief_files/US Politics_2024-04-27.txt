        "Title": "Shifting Perspectives and Global Support: Understanding the Dynamics of US Campus Protests",
        "Summary": "Recent US campus protests highlight a generational shift, with younger Americans showing more support for Palestinians, potentially impacting the Democratic Party and Biden\u2019s re-election chances (Al Jazeera). These protests, lacking the scale of historical movements yet significant, draw comparisons with past student movements and spotlight concerns over economic sanctions and social respect (Vox). Additionally, global reactions, including the backing from an influential Iraqi cleric, underline the international dimension of these demonstrations (France 24). The violent escalation on campuses like Columbia University reflects a contentious atmosphere, with administrations and law enforcement increasingly attempting to suppress these movements (Foreign Policy).",
