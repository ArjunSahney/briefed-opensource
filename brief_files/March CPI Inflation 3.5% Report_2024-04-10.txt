        "Title": "March Inflation Reports Signal Challenges for Federal Rate Cuts",
        "Summary": "March's CPI data shows a 3.5% year-over-year inflation increase, mainly driven by higher rent and gasoline costs, suggesting the Fed might delay interest rate cuts (USA Today). Elevated inflation, coupled with a strong job market and economic growth, undermines confidence in near-term rate reductions (CNET). Market expectations for rate cuts have significantly declined, highlighting uncertainty about the Fed's next moves amidst persistently high inflation (Investopedia).",
