### Celebrating International Women's Day 2024

In 2024, the International Women's Day theme is "Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress," spotlighting the vital roles of decent work and gender equality. Events include contributions from various representatives and performances by the ILO choir (1). The day, marked every March 8th, commemorates women's achievements and advocates for gender equality and diversity, as highlighted by this year's #InspireInclusion campaign (2). Historical tragedies, such as the death of 129 women in the 1908 Cotton Factory fire, underline the day's significance in advocating for women's rights and equality (3).
