This push, supported by Governor Jim Pillen and conservative factions, aligns with a broader strategy to consolidate electoral votes, albeit amidst opposition and a recent GOP official's resignation. Advocates argue this change mirrors the founders' intent and strengthens the state's unified voice, while critics see it as diminishing diverse political representation.
