### Bayern Munich vs. Lazio: UEFA Champions League Showdown

Bayern Munich is poised for a comeback in the UEFA Champions League after a surprising 1-0 first-leg defeat to Lazio. Despite their dominance in group stages, Bayern's recent form suggests vulnerability, with a significant reliance on striker Harry Kane for goals (Article 1). Lazio, on the other hand, has showcased strong defensive performances but faces challenges in maintaining consistency as they look to capitalize on their first-leg advantage (Article 1, Article 2). Betting experts favor Bayern Munich heavily, citing their home advantage and attacking prowess, despite acknowledging both teams' recent struggles (Article 2). However, skepticism exists around Bayern's current form and tactical approach, considering their disarray and the anticipated defensive strategy from Lazio (Article 3). The consensus among soccer analysts leans towards a Bayern Munich victory, though Lazio's odds offer intriguing upset potential (Article 1, Article 2, Article 3).
