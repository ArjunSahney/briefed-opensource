**Empowering Women in Tech: Sony and Nature's New Award**

Sony Group Corporation and Nature Portfolio have initiated the "Sony Women in Technology Award with Nature" to honor three early to mid-career female researchers in technology fields, including science, engineering, and mathematics. This award aims to address gender disparities in technology, where women hold less than a third of roles globally, by providing $250,000 to each winner to further their research and broadening their visibility on nature.com. The collaboration underscores the essential role of diverse expertise in driving innovation and the need to celebrate women's contributions to technology for a more inclusive future (Article 1, Article 2, Article 3).
