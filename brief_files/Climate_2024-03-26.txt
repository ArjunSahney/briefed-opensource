        "Summary": "Between 49-70% of current winegrowing regions may become unsuitable for grape cultivation due to climate change, with risks varying by global warming degrees (Nature). Wine production may shift northward, with regions like northern California and Europe potentially benefiting from warmer climates for premium wine production (Nature). Adaptation strategies include moving to higher altitudes or using supplementary irrigation in arid regions (Nature). Furthermore, a global map highlights the transformation of winegrowing regions in response to climate change (EurekAlert!).",
