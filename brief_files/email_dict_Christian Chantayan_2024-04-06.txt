            "Summary": "Former President Donald Trump is making a last-minute effort to have a new judge preside over his upcoming hush-money criminal trial, citing a conflict of interest due to the current judge's connections and accusing him of bias. Trump's legal team argues that the judge's ties to the Democratic party, through clients of Loren Merchan's firm, pose a conflict as Trump secures his position against President Joe Biden in the upcoming election. This attempt to recuse Judge Merchan comes amid Trump's broader legal struggles, including those involving financial backers of his civil fraud case. (NPR, NBC News, AOL.com, Yahoo News Canada)",
