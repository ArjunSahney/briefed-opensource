The Heisman Trust's decision was influenced by the changing landscape of college athletics, particularly the recognition and compensation of student-athletes. The Trust highlighted that current attitudes and legal perspectives towards athlete compensation necessitated the return of Bush's trophy (The Athletic). USC's supportive response included a surprise party for Bush, indicating institutional backing for the reinstatement (The Athletic). The Heisman Trust's process considered shifts in the college football landscape and legal challenges to the NCAA's amateurism model (Yardbarker).",
