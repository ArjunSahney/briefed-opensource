Meanwhile, China's state media, through voices like Hu Xijin, praise the US campus protests as indicative of weakened Jewish political and business control over American public opinion, despite suppressing similar dissent at home (Voice of America). The BBC provides an overarching narrative of the protests comparing different approaches, but without specific details (BBC).",
