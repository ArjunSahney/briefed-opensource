        "Title": "Trump Accuses Biden of Weak Antisemitism Stance Amid Own Controversial Comments",
        "Summary": "Donald Trump criticizes Joe Biden for a perceived weak response to antisemitism, especially regarding campus protests linked to the Gaza conflict, despite facing backlash for his own divisive language and actions. Trump's campaign emphasizes Biden's delayed reaction to the protests and accuses him of failing to condemn pro-Hamas sentiments, claiming Biden requires these votes (ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos). The White House declined calls to deploy the National Guard to curb protests, showing a restraint that contrasts with Trump's approach to similar issues (Benzinga). Amidst accusations, Biden plans to address antisemitism at a Holocaust remembrance event, highlighting his administration's commitment to combating hate and antisemitism (Yahoo).",
