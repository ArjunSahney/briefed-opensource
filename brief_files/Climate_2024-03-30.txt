        "Summary": "Recent studies suggest that climate change is slowing Earth's rotation, potentially delaying the introduction of a 'negative leap second' by three years (Earth.com). This alteration in Earth's spin could pose challenges to time measurement, affecting technological and data-driven aspects of the modern world, despite some skepticism over the predictability of these changes (ytech.news).",
