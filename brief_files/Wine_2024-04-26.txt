        "Summary": "In 2023, the global wine market faced significant challenges with consumption dropping to its lowest since 1996, totaling 221 million hectoliters, attributed to inflation and increased production costs (Vino Joy News). The same period saw a 10% decrease in wine production, largely blamed on climate change impacts, including extreme weather conditions like rains, floods, and fires, which also contributed to vineyard diseases (WION, Forbes). These adversities have led to a moderate decline in the world's total vineyard acreage by 0.5% to 7.2 million hectares (Forbes). The changes in climate have had a profound effect on traditional wine-producing countries, with significant production cuts reported globally (Business Matters, IOL).",
