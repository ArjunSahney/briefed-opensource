Good morning, Daniel Liu. Here is your morning briefing for today:

**Impact of Baltimore Bridge Collapse:**
The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore has notably disrupted local businesses and the broader supply chain. Business owners are anticipating challenges, yet there's hope for a swift recovery. Economic analysts stress this event underscores the vulnerability of U.S. supply chains, though minimal national economic and inflation impacts are expected. Recovery efforts are ongoing, highlighted by President Biden's recent visit to the site, as authorities found a third body, stressing the urgency for cleanup. The collapse has particularly affected coal exports and the automotive sectors, reinforcing concerns over supply chain resilience.

These incidents have raised broader conflict implications and underscored the risks faced by aid workers, with Israel's military admitting to procedural violations during these strikes.
