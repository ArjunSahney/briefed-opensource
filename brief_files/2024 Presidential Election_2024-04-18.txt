Kennedy Jr.'s independent campaign is poised to shake up the 2024 presidential race, complicating strategies for both incumbent President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump (USA Today). Polling data is beginning to illustrate a complex three-way race between Biden, Trump, and RFK Jr. (The Hill). In response, Biden and his allies are actively working to limit Kennedy's influence on the election outcome (Politico). Amidst this political maneuvering, Kerry Kennedy talks about the election, while the Kennedy family publicly endorses Biden, clearly distancing themselves from RFK Jr.'s candidacy (ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette).",
