### Soulslike Games: Evolution, Impact, and Future Prospects

Hidetaka Miyazaki, the legendary game director behind titles like Elden Ring, has made an indelible mark on the gaming industry by pioneering the soulslike genre. Despite fears of being pigeonholed, Miyazaki remains open to continuing in this vein, reflecting both a deep personal connection to these games and a broader influence on the genre (Article 1). Meanwhile, the upcoming Elden Ring DLC showcases the genre's massive appeal, inadvertently impacting the release strategies of indie soulslike games such as Enotria: The Last Song, which postponed its release to avoid clashing with the DLCâ€™s launch (Article 2). This scenario underscores not only the genre's popularity but also its vibrant, evolving ecosystem, influenced significantly by Miyazaki's pioneering work.
