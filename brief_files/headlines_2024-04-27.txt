        "Title": "Global University Protests Erupt in Solidarity with Palestine",
        "Summary": "Columbia University witnessed alumni reunion boycotts due to protests demanding the university divest from companies linked to Israel's war in Gaza, echoing a wider movement across the US, France, and Britain (Yahoo News UK). The protests, which have escalated to include encampments and demands for academic boycotts, received support from international figures and organizations, including the KKE leader in New York (eKathimerini.com) and were highlighted for standing in solidarity with Palestine (Peoples Dispatch). Controversy arose as a Hezbollah flag appearance at a US college protest sparked fury, underlining the intense atmosphere surrounding these demonstrations (Newsweek). The protests have been described as part of the most intense and widespread US demonstrations of the past six months, with demands extending to cutting ties with Israeli academic institutions and calling for ceasefires, amidst reports of Jewish students and faculty expressing fears for their safety (Yahoo News New Zealand).",
