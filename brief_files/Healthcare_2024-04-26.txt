        "Summary": "Gaza's healthcare workers endure the mental strain of ongoing conflict while providing vital medical aid and facing severe resource shortages, including performing amputations without anesthesia (MSF, Doctors Without Borders). Innovations like the MSF Paediatric Days aim to improve child healthcare amidst such crises (MSF). United Nations experts raise alarms over the mental health crises facing Gaza's citizens due to war (AOL.com). Amidst these challenges, a tragic case emerged where a premature baby girl, delivered after her mother's death in an airstrike, succumbed after five days in an incubator (WRAL.com).",
